You are tasked to create a program that will read in a text file and compute statistics on the contents.
Your program will count the number of alphabetic characters using isalpha(), the number of digits using isdigit() and the number of punctuation using ispunct(). 
(Zybook module 11). Your program will provide an appropriate report to display the analysis results to the user. 
Your program should work with any text file and the user should be able to select the file for input. You may create a test text file for testing and development. 
I suggest a short paragraph with punctuation and numbers that you can easily test the values with. Your array may be a VLA or FLA array. 
I suggest using an array of pointers and for each line of the text file allocate an array using calloc(). 
You may declare a static array, so long as it will hold 100 lines of 80 characters. A line length of 80 characters will be assumed.
